    <div class="mainbody">
        <p> Volleyball has always been a part of my life. My mother played in college, 
        my aunt played for the USA Olympics team, and I have played since I was a 
        little girl. Volleyball has taught the important lessons of perseverance and teamwork that have helped me 
        pursue my goals in life.

            In order to understand volleyball, one has to understand the fundamentals. Professional
            volleyball matches are played best of five sets or games. This means a team
            has to win 3 out of 5 games in order to win. When the ball is in play, each team
            has 3 touches on the ball before it has to go over the net to the opposing side. 
            A team wins the point if the ball touches the ground on the opposing teams side or if they 
            can't get the ball back over the net after 3 touches. For every touch, a player can 
            perform a variety of skills.

        <ol> <h1 class="olbig">Basic Skills of Volleyball: </h1>
            <li class="libasic"> Passing
                <ul>
                    <li class="liinside">Passing is one of the first skills used in
                        volleyball. It can be used both offensively and defensively. 
                        It is done through putting the hands together -- without crossing
                        the thumbs -- and bumping the ball towards the Setter. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li class="libasic"> Setting
                <ul>
                    <li class="liinside">Setting is a skill used by every player, but perfected by the Setter. The 
                        Setter's role is to be the player that touches almost every 2nd ball. Passers will pass it to the Setter
                        and the Setter will set it to the Hitters for the 3rd touch. Setting is down by putting
                        the hands above the hand and quickly pushing the ball in a direction using the fingers and wrists. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li class="libasic"> Hitting
                <ul>
                    <li class="liinside">Hitting typically comes after the set. A Hitters job is to hit -- spike --
                        the ball over the net and down onto the opposing teams court. To achieve this
                        the ball needs to be contacted at the highest reaching point and brought down
                        inside the court with a quick snap motion of the wrist. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li class="libasic"> Serving
                <ul>
                    <li class="liinside"> Serving is one of the most crucial skills
                        that a volleyball player can learn. Serves start every point in a 
                        match. The person who is serving will stand behind the back line and hit the ball with
                        with their palm to push it accross the net to the opposing team. There are several different
                        variations of serves: overhead, jump, float, etc. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
